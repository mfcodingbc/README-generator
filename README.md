# Professional README Generator

## Description

Struggling to create a great-looking README for your project? This project was created to help those who don't know how to best describe their work to other developers in GitHub and elsewhere in a README document. I too found it difficult to layout my project in a README, but after consulting this guide:
[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)
I decided to make code that would create the README based on user input within the terminal! This way, users shouldn't need to look up README guides and can quickly and easily create a professional README.

## Installation

In order to create your own professional README, you need the code from this project. To get this code, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine. Then, run the code with node.js in your terminal.
Answer the questions in the terminal, and once all questions have been answered, a README file will be created in the 'dist' folder. You can then admire your README and relax knowing that a professional README was made without you needing to create the file yourself!

## Usage

After creating your professional README, include it with your project. Move the README file to your desired folder and make sure to save it with a commit!

## Credits

Thanks to GitHub user [gchoi2u](https://github.com/gchoi2u) for the starter code that helped guide my work to include all the necessary functions to create a professional README file.

The README file was designed based on this [guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide).

This project fulfills the 'Module 9: Node.js.' assignment for MSU's Coding Bootcamp.
